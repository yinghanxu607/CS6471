% mdp_example_reserve   Generate a Markov Decision Process example based on
%                       a simple reserve design problem
%                       (see the related documentation for more detail)
% Arguments -------------------------------------------------------------
%   M(JxI) = species distribution across sites
%        J = number of sites (> 0), optional (default 5)
%        I = number of species (>0), optional (default 7)
%   pj = probability of development occurence, in ]0, 1[, optional (default 0.1)
% Evaluation -------------------------------------------------------------
%   P(SxSxA) = transition probability matrix
%   R(SxA) = reward matrix
%   M(JxI) = random species distribution across sites

    % Definition of states
    S=3^J;    % for each site, 0 is available; 1 is reserved; 2 is developed ;
    A=J;      % action space

    % There are J actions corresponding to the selection of a site for
    % reservation. A site can only be reserved if it is available.
    % By convention we will use a ternary base where state #0 is the state
    % that corresponds to [0,0, ..,0] all sites are available. State #1 is
    % [1,0,0,...,0]; state 2 is [2,0,0 ..,0] and state 3 is [0,1,0, .. 0] and so forth.
    % for example 
    % site = [0,0,1,2] means the first 2 sites are available (site(1:2)=0), site 3 is
    % reserved (site(3)=1) and site 4 is developped (site(4)=2).
